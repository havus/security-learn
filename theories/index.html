    <b>[READ GOALS]</b>
    <br>Before we start, its better to know list of characters that we will meet on this session.
    <br>This is alice, bob, eve (alias for eavesdropping), and malory (alias malicious or something maliciously)

    <br><br><b>First Story</b>
    okay, on the first story alice has plaintext and wanna send it, plaintext is a kind of message or electronic information or document,
    and alice encrypt with some private key or secret ket, and it resulting a ciphertext (unreadable format), and then alice send it to bob, and
    bob decrypt the ciphertext with the same key that alice used to encrypt the plaintext earlier.
    prerequisite on this case is alice and bob must have a same key to encrypt and decrypt the information.

    <br>So the question is, can eve read the information?
    Yes eve can read it if she has the key, right?
    <br>Can malory change the file? Of course yes, malory can do it if she has the key,
    and type of this encryption is symmetric encryption.

    <b>[READ DEFINITION]</b>
    Encrypt and decrypt use the same key, left side and right side is same, thats why its called by symmetric.

    <br><br>And the second type of encryption is asymmetric encryption.
    <b>[READ DEFINITION]</b>**and this the case:**
    <br>
    Alice generate her key pair. public key and private key,
    Private key must be kept secret (just like a key in symmetric cryptography),
    like the name right? private, keep it secret, keep it privately.
    and the public key can be given to anyone, trusted or not <b>[click]</b>

    <br>Someone with the public key is able to encrypt a message <b>[click]</b>,
    and then only the person in possession of the private key is able to decrypt it.
    i mean the private key pair of the public key <b>[click]</b>, and others private key can NOT decrypt it,
    just only the private key pair.

    and the other side, bob also generate his key pair and share his public key to everyone.
    <br>On this story alice has a plaintext, as we know, public key can used for encrypt some information,
    so alice encrypt with bob's public key, and resulting ciphertext that only bob's private key can decrypt it.
    <br>And then alice send the ciphertext to bob. and only bob can decrypt it.
    <br>So, the question is can eve read the ciphertext during the transfer? NO, except she has bob's private key.
    <br>and the next question is, can malory change the data during the transfer? can Malory pretend as alice?
    maybe <b>YES</b>, cause there is no authentication on this case, no identification at all.
    bob didnt know whether the file sent by alice or malory, cause all of them has bob's public key,
    anyone be able to encrypt anything and send it to bob.
    and how to alice say to bob, "hi this file is from me, not from malory", what should alice do?

    <br>Okay, this is the second function of the private key is, to sign the document or the file 
    <b>[click]</b>, and then anyone with the public key pair is able to verify that the message was created by someone has the corresponding private key.
    <br>Okay and then, alice sign the ciphertext with her private key, and then it will generate a verified ciphertext.
    and send it to bob, bob can verify with alice's public key, and bob said "oh this from alice".
    <b>BUT</b> can eve read the file? still no, but eve can see the file is from alice
    cause eve has alice public key, eve can verify it and say, "oh this is from alice",
    so the confidentiality is reduced cause everyone can see who is the sender.
    <br>Second question is, can malory snaps up the message during transfer or transit on router?
    Yes still can. Cause mallory can discard the attached signature of Alice (separate alice signature with ciphertext)
    and malory gets the encrypted message (but malory still can NOT read it because she doesn’t have the private key pair).
    And after malory remove alice signature, then Mallory attaches her OWN signature to the encrypted message
    and sends it to Bob.
    <br>Bob receives the message, verifies Mallory’s signature as valid, decrypts and reads the content, or the decrypted request.

    <b>The danger</b>here is that Bob believes Mallory to be the person who wrote the message, "oh this is from malory"
    and he send Mallory a response that is an alice secret, ley example its a request for product list of alice's e-commerce,
    and response will be catched by malory.
    <br>Since the document sign by malory private key, bob also will verify with malory public key.
    why bob encrypt use malory public key? cause previously the request verified by malory public key.
    And then response will encrypted with malory public key and sign the response by bob's private key,
    So, malory can read the response and alice can NOT open the response.

    <br>So, the problem is sign after encryption, what if sign first and encrypt then? Okay lets try
    <b>[next slide]</b>
    <br>The first step we sign the document with alice's private key,
    and then encrypt it with bob's public key, and send it to bob.
    On the bob side, bob receive the file and decrypt it with bob's private key and verify the document with alice's public key.
    
    <br><br>Okay lets go back to our previous question, can eve know the file and know who is the sender? 
    <b>[click]</b> Absolutely no cause eve doesnt has bob private key to decrypt it, and now signature inside the encryption, Eve can not know the sender.
    So, on this case already cover the confidentiality. <b>[click]</b>

    <br>and the next question is can malory pretend as sender? <b>[click]</b>
    Malory sign the encrypted document with her private key, and said to bob,
    "hey this is my file, and i already sign with my private key, you can use my public key to verify it",
    now bob verify it, and decrypt it and verify again with malory public key, but its NOT match,
    cause previously file has signed by alice, bob will has question, why there is different verifications?
    so, bob reject the suspicious request, thats why most of people do a multiple sign to the document <b>[click]</b>,
    but the most important thing is sign before encryption.
    <br>Sign the plain text, encrypt it and sign again to avoid suspicious requests like this.
    now malory can NOT pretend as alice its mean,.. already cover their authenticity. <b>[click]</b>

    <br><br>its looks like asymmetric encryption is more secure, and how about speed? yes of course, asymmetric encryption run slower than symmetric encryption.
    The question is, how to encrypt let say a book with size 200 giga bytes,
    with asymmetric encryption it will be very slow, of course depend on hardware,
    <br>But in this case, most of people combine symmetric and asymmetric to avoid slow performance for large file. How?

    <br><b>[next slide]</b>
    <br>Let say alice has a book, and she wanna send it to bob, alice gerenate a <b>symmetric</b> key it can be random,
    and send it to bob with asymmetric encryption. and encrypt the book with previous symmetric key, and send it to bob,
    and bob will decrypt it with the symmetric key that exchange previously.
    that way will be faster rather than just using asymmetric encryption for the book.
    <br>So, lemme summarize the use cases for asymmetric and symmetric.
    <br><b>[READ SLIDE]</b>

    <br><br><b>PKI</b>
    <br>Do we ever think about, how to distribute our public key?
    Tell everybody this is our public key? hey alice this my public key, and hey bob this is my public key.
    Instead send public key to the others one by one, what if put our public key on the public place?
    that everyone can access it. sounds good, right? and this is what PKI offer.

    <br><br>What is the PKI?<br><b>[READ SLIDE]</b>

    <br><b>[READ DEFINITION]</b><br>
    Some people says its the process of managing practically every aspect of digital certificates.
    This cover the policies and procedures, the hardware and software behind these digital cerfiticates
    and of course the entire digital certificate process, starting with the creation all the way through the revocation.

    <br>What does the digital certificate look like? <b>[READ SLIDE]</b>
    Okay let say there is alice and bob's server, how to make alice believes that it's really bob server?
    and Not a phising server?
    <br>in this case Bob need a digital certificate. how to get his digital certificate?
    <br>okay here we go, the first step bob will request to RA, bob needs to answer some question from RA.
    <br>basically, RA is responsible for accepting requests for digital certificates and authenticating the entity that making the request.
    <br>RA might be robot or migth be NOT, so might be automatic process. and in the end RA said "okay you eligible to request certificate to CA",
    and RA will tells the CA to issue bob certificate. "Hi CA, please make create certificate for bob, and this is his information (including bob public key)",
    <br>and CA will be an issuer for bob certificate, and this process can called by CSR (Certificate Signing Request).
    <b>[click]</b>

    <br><br>Okay let move on, and bob will send the certificate to alice every alice request to the server.
    now, can alice trust the certificate immediately? what if it's a fake certificate?
    okay alice will see digital signature from CA on the digital certificate, digital signature is just like verification, who has sign bob certificate,
    <br>let example "oh this certificate issued by Sectigo" and can alice trust the CA immediately?
    can alice trust <b>Sectigo</b>? maybe alice can NOT identify whether the CA is trusted or NOT, but the browser can.

    <br><br>Browser will maintain a list of all the trusted comercial certificate authority, built in to alice browser.
    <b>[click]</b> We can see the list from firefox...[read some example] and browser can verify digital signature on bob certificate with one of CA on the list.
    <br><br><b>[click]</b> okay btw, there is an useless image over there.
    root CA, what is root CA?
    <br> okay, there is something called by <b>Certificate path</b>.
    Lets inpect jurnal certificate, Root CA is the issuer of intermediate CA certificate,
    not only bob has certificate, all of CA also has certificate, we can see intermediate CA certificate issued by Root CA.
    Root CA are self-signed <b>[click]</b>. Let see the image, subject and issuer is same, <b>USERTRUST NETWORK</b> certificate issued by their own-self.
    and intermediate CA certificate which is Sectigo in here, has issued by <b>USERTRUST NETWORK</b>
    <br><br><b>[click]</b>.....<b>[click]</b>. 
    and intermediate CA will be issuer for jurnal.id

    <br><br>Okay lets go back to the previous case.
    Once alice receive bobs certificate, browser will auto verify bob certificate,
    browser has sectigo certificate on the list of CA's (which is built in to browser),
    sectigo certificate's contain sectigo public key.
    and browser use sectigo public key to verify bob certificate cause bob certificate signed by sectigo private key previously.
    <br>So, alice can trust bob public key that is attached on bob certificate.

    <br><br>and.. Done that is my sharing session, if u have question u can write it on the google meet Q&A,
    i'll give this stage back to mas adani, thank u mas.
